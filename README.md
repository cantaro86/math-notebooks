## Math notebooks
Here I put some unclassified math notebooks. They are not specifically about quantitative finance.

List of notebooks:

- **Effective resistance and Flows on a graph**: With simple examples I show how to compute the effective resistance between two nodes in a graph.  I also show how to compute the pressure $p$ (or potential $V$) on each internal node, and the flow $Q$ (or current $I$) on each edge.

- **Reflected Ornstein Uhlenbeck process**: Definition and simulation of this stochastic process. MLE parameter estimation. Numerical solution of the associated Fokker-Plank equation.
