## Math notebooks
Here I put some unclassified math notebooks. They are not specifically about quantitative finance.

List of notebooks:

- **1 - Reflected Ornstein Uhlenbeck process**: Definition and simulation of this stochastic process. MLE parameter estimation. Numerical solution of the associated Fokker-Plank equation.

- **2 - Effective resistance on a graph**: With simple examples I show how to compute the effective resistance between two nodes in a graph.  I also show how to compute the pressure $p$ (or the electric potential $V$) on each internal node, and the flow $Q$ (or electric current $I$) on each edge, by solving the Ohm law $V = R I$ 

- **3 - Scipy vs PETSc for a linear system with Laplacian matrix**: Short tutorial on PETSc vector, matrices and linear solvers. The example considers a graph Laplacian matrix.
